
## Internal Coherence Protocol: Scene-Painting for Slopratchet

**Core Principle:**  Effective scene-painting within Slopratchet focuses on crafting highly detailed, *sensory-rich* moments that demonstrably reinforce the established rules and aesthetics of the world. It’s not about inventing entirely new systems, but about skillfully layering believable details onto a foundation already built.  The goal is to create a world where actions *feel* real and consistent with its core properties.

**I. Defining the Scope: Anchoring Authenticity**

Before beginning, firmly establish what aspects of Slopratchet are *already* known and codified through the Story World Codex. This isn’t a top-down imposition but a recognition of what already exists.

*   **Known Systems:**  Document key systems (e.g., the influence of the Chronarium, the prevalence of Glyth-Tech, the social structure of the Cog-Guilds)
*   **Established Aesthetics:**  Slopratchet's signature look & feel:  Rusting clockwork, bio-luminescent fungi, steam-powered automatons, iridescent rain, unsettling geometry.

**II.  The Painting Process: Layering Detail**

1.  **Scene Goal:**  What *specific* narrative function does this scene serve? (e.g., introduce a character, reveal a clue, create a suspenseful moment, demonstrate a key rule).

2.  **Sensory Detail – The Core** - Prioritize details that engage all five senses.  Don’t just say “it was a dark alley.” Instead:
    *   **Sight:** "The alley was choked with a greasy, phosphorescent mist, illuminated by the sickly green glow of algae-powered streetlamps.  A half-disassembled chronometer lay discarded in a puddle, its hands frozen at 3:17."
    *   **Sound:** “A low, rhythmic grinding emanated from a nearby automatons, punctuated by the squelch of oily rain and the distant cry of a Gloom-Weasel.”
    *   **Smell:** “The air hung heavy with the scent of rust, ozone, and something acridly sweet – likely decaying Glith-Tech."
    *   **Touch:** "The cobblestones were slick with a viscous residue, cold and strangely smooth beneath his boots."
    *   **Taste:** (If relevant) “He caught a metallic tang on his tongue, a reminder of the constant exposure to Glyth-dust."

3. **Character Integration:** Every character should *feel* like a product of Slopratchet.  Their appearance, speech, behaviors, and motivations should be consistent with the world’s established rules and aesthetics.

4. **Glyth-Tech & Temporal Anomalies:**  Slopratchet is *defined* by its broken time and technology.  Introduce small, believable glitches, malfunctions, or temporal echoes.  Don't over-explain; a flickering streetlamp that suddenly displays a scene from a bygone era can be more impactful than an extensive explanation of temporal distortion.

5.  **The Cog-Guild’s Influence:** Ensure every location reflects the Cog-Guild's presence—whether through surveillance, automated patrols, or the remnants of their influence.

**III. Maintaining Internal Coherence – Cross-Referencing**

1.  **System Validation:**  After establishing a scene, check if the details reinforce established systems.  Does the appearance of a certain type of automatons align with the Cog-Guild’s control?  Does a temporal anomaly reflect the Chronarium’s interference?

2.  **Aesthetic Consistency:**  Does everything in the scene contribute to Slopratchet’s signature look and feel?  Avoid introducing elements that clash with the established aesthetic (e.g., a pristine, untouched plaza would be highly incongruous).

3. **Document and Link:** Maintain a system for tracking confirmed details—linking them to relevant sections within the Story World Codex. This helps to avoid contradictions and ensures a consistent narrative.



**IV.  Generative Potential – Seeds for Expansion**

*   **Recurring NPCs:**  Characters introduced in a scene can become recurring figures, with established motivations and relationships.
*   **Location as a ‘Micro-System':**  Each location should have a degree of self-contained operation—its own inhabitants, resources, and potential conflicts.
*   **"Seeds of Plot":** Introduce small, unresolved elements that can be developed into larger plot threads.



**V.  Design Checks:  Evaluating Scene Authenticity**

*   **"Does it *feel* Slopratchet?**  The most important test—does the scene authentically capture the world's essence?
*   **System Validation (Repeat):** Reconfirm consistency with the Story World Codex.
*   **Sensory Impact:**  Does the scene evoke a strong sensory experience for the reader/player?



**Example – Applying the Protocol**

Let’s say we’re describing a character entering a derelict Clockwork Foundry.

*   **Goal:** Introduce a new character – Silas, a disillusioned inventor.
*   **Sensory Detail:** “The Foundry smelled of burnt gears, ozone, and something vaguely floral—a lingering scent from the bioluminescent fungi that had once illuminated the space. Rain, filtered through layers of rusted chronometers, dripped onto his boots.  He navigated through a labyrinth of collapsed machinery, the skeletal remains of automated repair drones flickering intermittently with a sickly blue light.  A single, perfectly formed gear—a cog from the Grand Chronometer—lay on a workbench, as if deliberately placed."
*   **System Validation:** Silas's presence aligns with the Cog-Guild’s influence over key technological locations.
*   **Aesthetic Consistency:** The overall scene evokes the established look and feel of broken clockwork technology and bio-luminescent flora.
