## The Art of Immersive Scene-Painting: Lickskillet – Internal Coherence Protocol

**Target World:** Slopratchet

**Protocol Objective:** To establish and maintain a consistently believable, atmospheric, and narratively rich environment within the Slopratchet heterocosm through skillful scene-painting.

---

## I. Scene Specification – Lickskillet: The Dockside Exchange

**Setting:** Lickskillet – A ramshackle port town clinging to the edge of the brackish Slorp River, perpetually shrouded in a humid haze and smelling strongly of brine, rotting vegetation, and faintly metallic engine oil.

**Time Period (Implied):** Post-Collapse – Approximately 75 years after the Great Dissolution (the event that fractured reality and birthed Slorpratchet). The architecture is a bizarre patchwork of salvaged pre-Collapse structures – corrugated steel, repurposed shipping containers, and the skeletal remains of towering concrete buildings – integrated with makeshift repairs and adaptations.

**Sensory Details:**

*   **Sight:** The dominant colors are muted – rust-brown, swamp green, faded blues, and the oily sheen of perpetually damp surfaces. Buildings lean at odd angles.  Scavengers and riverboats create a chaotic visual dance. The river itself is a murky, shimmering grey.
*   **Sound:** The constant drone of the Slorp River, punctuated by the clang of metal on metal, the shouts of dockworkers, the mournful call of automated water-skimmers, and the occasional blast of a steam-powered ‘river-digger.’
*   **Smell:** (As noted above)  Brine, rot, oil, something vaguely akin to burnt sugar (likely from the local biofuel distilleries), and the unsettling musk of the Slorp River’s unique microbial life.
*   **Touch:** Damp air, slick surfaces, the rough texture of salvaged metal, the warm, gritty feel of the riverbed beneath your feet.



**Character Introductions (Potential NPCs):**

*   **Cletus "Wrench" Blackwood:** The Dock Boss – a grizzled veteran with a prosthetic arm built from salvaged machinery. He runs the daily trade, maintains a precarious control over the docks, and has a reputation for being both shrewd and ruthless. His voice is gravelly, and his eyes hold a wary intelligence. Wears a stained mechanic’s jumpsuit and a perpetually damp bowler hat.
*   **Mara "River's Eye" Volkov:** A skilled river scout and scavenger, known for her ability to navigate the treacherous currents and locate valuable salvage. She’s fiercely independent, pragmatic, and carries a modified crossbow.
*   **Silas "Cogsmith" Grimshaw:** A retired engineer who operates a small repair shop specializing in automaton maintenance and modifications.  His workshop is a chaotic jumble of gears, wires, and half-disassembled automatons.



**Key Locations:**

*   **The Dockside Exchange:** The main trading hub - a collection of makeshift stalls and platforms presided over by Cletus.
*   **Grimshaw’s Automaton Repairs:** Silas’s workshop – a critical source of spare parts and repair services.
*   **The Rusty Mug:** A ramshackle tavern where dockworkers and river scouts gather to drink, gamble, and trade stories.
*   **The Slorp River:** A key navigational hazard and resource.

## II. World Rule Anchors & Coherence

**1. Core Primal Mama Elements:**

*   **Bayou-Infused Realism:** Lickskillet is deeply embedded in a semi-submerged, semi-transformed landscape, influenced by the Great Dissolution.
*   **Retro-Futuristic Aesthetic:** Combines salvaged pre-Collapse technology with makeshift adaptations, reflecting a society struggling to rebuild from a fractured past.
*   **Spiritual Miasma:**  A pervasive sense of unease, magic, and the presence of residual reality distortions—a core element of Slorpratchet’s environment.

**2. Slorpratchet Systemic Rules – Layered Implementation:**

*   **Gun Ownership Regional:** Gun ownership is common, but regulated by local authority (Cletus).
*   **Automaton User Stigma (Tolerated):** Automatons are accepted, but viewed with suspicion and a degree of social discomfort.
*   **Slorp River Hazards:** Navigation and resource gathering are inherently dangerous due to unpredictable currents, shifting terrain, and potential ‘reality echoes’.
*   **“River-Diggers” and Salvage Trade:** The primary economic engine.

## III. Generative Potential & Narrative Hooks

*   **Salvage Operations:** Opportunities for exploration, resource gathering, and encountering dangerous “echoes” of the past.
*   **Automaton Disputes:** Conflicts between factions or individuals seeking to control automaton technology.
*   **River-Based Threats:** Encounters with mutated river creatures, rogue river-diggers, or territorial river settlements.
*   **“Reality Echoes” Investigations:** Discovering and investigating anomalous phenomena – remnants of the Dissolution, potentially valuable, potentially dangerous.
*   **Trade Disputes:** Cletus is a key figure; conflicts over trade routes and resource control would be commonplace.

## IV.  Refinement & Iteration

This framework serves as a foundation.  Detailed mapping, NPC biographies, and specific event triggers will continue to build upon this initial specification.



**Note:** This framework is designed to be adaptable.  Expanding upon specific areas—resource availability, political dynamics, or the nature of the "reality echoes"—will further enrich the Slorpratchet world.
```

**Key Changes & Rationale:**

*   **More Sensory Detail:** I've expanded the sensory details to make the setting feel more immersive.
*   **Specific Character Introductions:**  Added brief descriptions for potential NPCs.
*   **Refined Rule Anchors:** I’ve emphasized the core Slorpratchet system rules for greater consistency.
*   **Emphasis on Generative Hooks:**  I’ve created a more extensive list of narrative possibilities.
*   **Streamlined Structure:**  Improved the organization for clarity and ease of reference.

To help me further refine this file, could you tell me:

*   **What specific aspects of the Slorpratchet world are you most interested in developing further?** (e.g., the nature of the "reality echoes," the political landscape, the technology, or the culture?)
*   **Are there any particular types of stories or gameplay you envision taking place in Lickskillet?** (e.g., exploration, combat, investigation, trade, political intrigue?)
*   **What level of detail are you aiming for in the overall worldbuilding?** (e.g., a broad overview, or a highly detailed world with extensive maps and documentation?)
