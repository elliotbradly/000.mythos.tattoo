* Purpose: To define the primary sensory experiences and overall mood created *within this specific scene*.*

*   **Visual Palette &  Lighting:**
    *   *Authenticated Details:* `Dominated by muddy browns, murky greens of the water, and  faded, peeling paint (mustard yellows, avocado greens, rust oranges typical of 1970s palettes) on buildings . Occasional glint of chrome from boat engines or weaponry. The diffuse, grey light from the overcast sky. Flick ering neon sign. Chunky, utilitarian design for all visible tech, even newer solar panels have faux-woodgrain bez els or oversized analog dials.`
    *   *Intended Visual Mood:* `Gritty, Worn-Down, Functional,  Resilient, Slightly Oppressive.`

*   **Auditory Landscape:**
    *   *Authenticated Sounds:* `Slap of water against hulls and pilings. The intermittent roar and whine of fanboat engines starting or arriving. Distant , rhythmic thumping or grinding from unseen processing machinery. Raised voices, gruff laughter, and occasional arguments from the locals . The buzz of large insects. Perhaps a scratchy radio playing a tune reminiscent of Jerry Reed from the cookhouse, distorted  through an old speaker with a chunky grille.`
    *   *Intended Auditory Mood:* `Rough, Working -Class, A Little Lawless, Background Hum of Industry.`

*   **Olfactory Profile:**
    *    *Authenticated Smells:* `Pervasive metallic tang of blood and rendered alligator fat. Diesel/biofuel fumes  from boat engines. Damp earth and decaying swamp vegetation. Frying food (gator nuggets?) from the cookhouse. Un washed bodies. A faint, acrid chemical scent from tanning or preservation processes carried on the breeze.`
    *   *Intended  Olfactory Mood:* `Pungent, Visceral, Industrial, Unsanitary but Familiar to Locals.`

*    **Tactile Sensations (Implied or Directly Experienced):**
    *   *Authenticated Sensations:* `Th ick, humid air clinging to skin. The stickiness of mud underfoot if one steps off the main boardwalks. The  vibration of a nearby fanboat engine. The rough texture of weathered wood on railings or building walls.`
    *   *Int ended Tactile Mood:* `Clammy, Gritty, Unrefined.`

*   **Overall Authenticated Atmosphere for THIS SC ENE:** `Lickskillet Landing is the raw, unvarnished gut of the alligator meat industry. It's  a place of hard labor, casual danger, and a defiant, make-do spirit, all filtered through a distinctively  grimy 1970s lens. It smells of work, blood, and swamp, and hums with a  rough-edged energy.`

*   **# Design Check:** *Do the authenticated sensory details work together to create a powerful  and consistent atmosphere for this specific scene? Yes, they aim to convey the gritty, functional, and somewhat hazardous nature of Lick skillet, consistent with its role in Primal Mama.*
