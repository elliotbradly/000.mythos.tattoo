## Introduction: Crafting Immersive Moments Through Localized Detail

*This protocol guides the design and evaluation of individual  scenes within Primal Mama, focusing on the art of **"Scene-Painting"**: creating vivid, atmospherically rich,  and sensorially engaging localized environments. While distinct from deep heterocosm construction (world-making), skillful scene-painting  is crucial for immediate immersion, tone setting, and providing context for character action.*

*Use this document to ensure each key  scene possesses a strong sense of place and mood, built through carefully authenticated (for the scene) details. Consider how these details serve  the immediate narrative and whether they have implications for broader world consistency.*

## I. Scene Spatio-Temporal  Authentication (The Immediate "Where & When")

*Purpose: To establish the clear, immediate physical and temporal boundaries of  the scene.*

*   **Authenticated Location:** `[INPUT]` 
    *   *Key Authenticated Spatial Features (for this scene):* `[INPUT]`
*   **Authenticated Time:** `[INPUT]`
    *   *Key Authenticated Temporal Features (for this scene): * `[INPUT]`

*    **# Design Check:** *The 'where' and 'when' are clear, establishing an industrial, nocturnal setting consistent  with Lickskillet's role and the 70s aesthetic. The Gram Parsons hint ties into the world' s deified celebrities.*
