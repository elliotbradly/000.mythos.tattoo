Authenticated to have embraced the Adam ant Rite after witnessing a mass Dissolution event early in its existence, which it perceived as a horrifying loss of form.]` #  Auth: [Plausible backstory given Rite's tenets]
    *   `- Key Past Event Connection: [Survived  the 'Grinding of Sector Epsilon-Prime,' where it successfully maintained its form through disciplined "Grounding Rites" while  many others were Shattered or Dissolved. This event solidified its status as an "Earth Keeper."]` # Auth:  [Hypothetical significant past event]
    *   `- Inherited Items/Knowledge: [Possesses orally transmitted knowledge of ancient , now-depleted "Earth's Kiss" veins and specific "Body Mandalas" said to be passed down from  the first Adamants. No physical inherited items, as Globs don't typically possess objects in that manner.]` # Auth:  [GICP v0.6 - "Earth Scrimshaw" idea adapted]
    *   `# Historical  Undersaturation: [Specific details of its existence before fully committing to the Adamant Rite; the exact lineage of its "Earth  Keeper" knowledge.]`
