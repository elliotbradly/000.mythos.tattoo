    *   `- Property ID: MODAL-FERRUS-AR- 001`
        *   *Property:* `[Ritual-Enhanced Bodily Cohesion (Alethic/ Psychosomatic Efficacy)]`
        *   *Description:* `[Ferrus's unwavering commitment to Adam ant Rite practices, particularly "being in the body" and "Earth Superstition," results in an authenticated, albeit subtle , increase in its physical density and resistance to environmental stressors (CMP deprivation, minor impacts) beyond baseline Glop capabilities. Its  "True Shards," upon Shattering, are also authenticated to be of higher quality/density.]`
        *   * Limits:* `[Does not confer invulnerability. Extreme Ratchetwork forces or direct Harvester intervention can still lead to Shattering or  unwanted processing. The effect is primarily on resilience and shard quality, not granting new physical powers.]`
        *   *Authentication :* `[GICP v0.6, Core Rules 1 & 3, stipulating ritual efficacy and influence on Shat tering/shard quality. Narrative demonstrations of Ferrus enduring where others might fail.]`
    *   `# Note: This  modal property is an outcome of the world's authenticated rules regarding ritual impact, not a violation of them.`
