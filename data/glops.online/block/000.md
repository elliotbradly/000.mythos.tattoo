**1. Physical Properties (Authenticated Form & Sensory Signature):**
   *Purpose: Define  the character's tangible presence, heavily influenced by Adamant Rite practices.*
    *   `- Appearance_General:  [A relatively large, dense Glop. Form is a more consistently maintained ovoid shape than average Globs, showing  less amorphous drift. Coloration is a deep, matte ochre, flecked with minute, embedded mineral particles from  "Earth's Kiss" rituals.]` # Auth: [GICP v0.6 - Adamant Rite descriptions ]
    *   `- Appearance_Specific Features: [Surface texture is less viscous, almost like packed, damp earth, with areas  exhibiting a subtle, hardened sheen. Faint, concentric striations visible internally, suggesting layers of ritual self-compression.]`  # Auth: [GICP v0.6 - "HARDening"]
    *   `- Appearance_Distinctive Marks: [ Several "True Scars" – healed fissures from near-Shattering events that have recalcified into denser, slightly  crystalline lines. One prominent scar is deliberately dusted with a specific grey mineral powder from a favored "Earth's Kiss" site .]` # Auth: [GICP v0.6 - "True Shards" concept applied to living form]
    *    `- Typical Attire: [N/A for Globs. Ferrus's "attire" is its  cultivated physical form and adhered mineral dusts.]` # Auth: [GICP v0.6 - Glop nature ]
    *   `- Voice/Speech Pattern: [Produces communication through resonant, low-frequency vibrations and deliberate,  percussive clicks. Speech patterns are slow, measured, and often incorporate phrases emphasizing "the body," "integrity," "solidity ," and "Grounding." Avoids terms of fluidity or dissolution.]` # Auth: [Inferred from Adamant Rite values ]
    *   `- Gait/Mannerisms: [Movement is ponderous but controlled, exhibiting slightly more controlled momentum due  to density (per "Kineto-Mist" principle). Frequently engages in "Grounding Rites" – prolonged,  still contact with stable Ratchetwork sections. Occasionally observed meticulously arranging found particulates into symbolic "Body Mandalas."]` # Auth:  [GICP v0.6 - Adamant Rite practices, "Kineto-Mist"]
    *   `- Associated  Scent (If Any): [Faint odor of dry earth, specific mineral dusts (slightly metallic/chalky), and  the ozone tang of nearby Ratchetwork operations.]` # Auth: [Implied by "Earth's Kiss" and environment ]
    *   `# Physical Undersaturation: [Exact internal mass distribution; precise mechanism of vibratory speech ; full range of non-ritualistic movement.]`
