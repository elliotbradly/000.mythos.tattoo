**2. Functional Properties (Authenticated Capabilities & Limitations):** 
   *Purpose: Define what the character *can* and *cannot* do, as shaped by its Adamant faith.* 
    *   `- Skill: [Expert in identifying potent "Earth's Kiss" mineral veins and safe, stable  "Grounding Plates" within the Ratchetwork.]` # Auth: [GICP v0.6 - Adam ant Rite, "Earth Superstition"]
    *   `- Skill: [Mastery of Adamant Rite rituals:  voluntary CMP restriction, seeking desiccating micro-environments, ritualistic self-compression techniques for density enhancement.]` # Auth: [G ICP v0.6 - Adamant Rite practices]
    *   `- Skill: [Teaching and guiding other Globs in the  principles of "being in the body" and the Adamant Rite's "Bodily Way."]` # Auth: [Impl ied role of "Earth Keeper" from GICP v0.6]
    *   `- Ability (Unique): [ Significantly increased resistance to accidental Desiccation/Shattering due to ritual HARDening and focused "Bodily Integrity."  Can maintain form under stressors that would affect uninitiated Globs more rapidly.]` # Auth: [GICP v0.6  - Goal of Adamant Rite]
    *   `- Limitation (Physical): [Reduced locomotive speed and pliability compared to L iquescent Way followers or average Globs. Vulnerable to sudden, extreme shearing forces that bypass its compressive strength.]` # Auth:  [Consequence of HARDening]
    *   `- Limitation (Knowledge): [Limited understanding or intentional rejection of L iquescent Way principles; knowledge of Ratchetwork is primarily through the lens of "Earth Superstition" (sacred sites)  rather than its overarching mechanics.]` # Auth: [GICP v0.6 - Inter-path differences]
    *    `- Limitation (Social): [Viewed with scorn or pity by Liquescent Way followers; may be seen as stubbornly  fanatical by Globs neutral to the spiritual paths.]` # Auth: [GICP v0.6 - Axi ological differences]
    *   `# Functional Undersaturation: [Ability to directly manipulate Ratchetwork systems; detailed  knowledge of Harvester subroutines; skills unrelated to Adamant Rite or basic Glop survival.]`
