**6.  Axiological Properties (Authenticated Value/Reputation):**
   *Purpose: Define the character's value status *within*  Glopratchet.*
    *   `- Reputation (Adamant Rite Followers): [Venerated as a pillar of faith,  an embodiment of "bodily integrity," a wise "Earth Keeper." His words on "being in the body" carry  significant weight.]` # Auth: [GICP v0.6 - Adamant values]
    *   `- Reputation ( Liquescent Way Followers): [Likely viewed as tragically misguided, stubbornly clinging to transient physical form, fearful of true  release/transcendence. A symbol of what they seek to move beyond.]` # Auth: [GICP v0. 6 - Liquescent values]
    *   `- Reputation (Harvesters): [Categorized as 'Gl op Material Unit FERRUS_AR_001'. Properties (density, mineral inclusions) noted for potential processing efficiency.  Spiritual beliefs are unacknowledged and irrelevant to Harvester protocols.]` # Auth: [GICP v0.6  - Harvester indifference]
    *   `- Moral Alignment (Narrative Framing): [Protagonist (within Adamant Rite context)  or tragic figure (from an external viewpoint). Represents a profound, if perhaps doomed, assertion of meaning through physical self-actual ization in an indifferent universe.]` # Auth: [GICP v0.6 - Thematic implications]
    *   ` # Axiological Undersaturation: [Reputation among unaligned Globs; specific assessments by individual Harvester units ( if they ever make such distinctions).]`
