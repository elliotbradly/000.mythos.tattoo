# Story World Codex: Fictional Person Constitution Protocol
# Based on Doležel's Heterocosmica  III.B.II.C (Character as Property Bundle)

**Last Updated:** [Current Date]
** Lead Architect(s):** [Your Name/Studio Name]

## Introduction: Constituting Fictional  Persons Textually

*This protocol guides the detailed definition of **Fictional Persons** (characters, significant sentient beings) within  the Glopratchet heterocosm. Following Doležel's framework, characters **ARE** constituted by the **bundle  of properties authenticated for them** by the authoritative narrative source (this Codex, core narratives, Glopratchet Internal Coherence Protocol v 0.6). They possess **no independent psyche or reality beyond this textual definition**.*

*Use this template to systematically build characters  by explicitly authenticating their properties across relevant categories. Focus on creating multifaceted individuals whose complexity arises from the **richness,  coherence, and potential tensions within their authenticated bundle**, and whose actions are logically grounded in their defined nature and the world's rules , especially concerning their relationship with their bodies and the prevailing spiritual paths. Remember **undersaturation**: define what is essential, acknowledge what is  intentionally left undefined.*

### Character Constitution Summary & Narrative Function:

*Purpose: Synthesize the core identity , internal conflicts, and narrative role emerging from the authenticated property bundle.*

*   **Core Essence:** `Ferrus is constituted  as a living testament to the Adamant Rite's "Bodily Imperative" within Glopratchet. Its  Physical properties (density, mineral adornments, controlled form) are direct, authenticated manifestations of its Psychological devotion ("being in the body ," reverence for "Earth") and Functional capabilities (ritual mastery, resilience). Its Social role as an "Earth Keeper" is  intrinsically tied to its belief system, and its unique Modal property (Ritual-Enhanced Bodily Cohesion) is an  authenticated outcome of this faith within Glopratchet's rules. Ferrus embodies a profound, stoic effort to find meaning and  achieve a "noble end" through the affirmation and disciplined cultivation of its physical self, in stark defiance of a universe geared  towards relentless throughput and unmaking.`
*   **Primary Narrative Function:** `To serve as a primary exponent and living  example of the Adamant Rite philosophy; to act as a mentor, spiritual guide, or elder figure for Globs seeking meaning through  "the importance of the body"; to provide a clear philosophical counterpoint to the Liquescent Way and the perceived nihil ism of the Ratchetwork; to explore themes of faith, embodiment, resilience, and the nature of a "good  death" in a hostile world.`
*   **Key Internal Conflicts (From Bundle):** `The constant tension between its  deeply held faith in "bodily integrity" and the overwhelming evidence of the Ratchetwork's destructive power. The  struggle to maintain stoic resolve and continue "Earth Superstition" rituals when sacred sites are destroyed or fellow Adamants are  ignobly processed. The internal debate about whether its focus on the body is ultimate wisdom or a tragic, beautiful folly.` 
*   **Potential for Development (Based on Bundle):** `Ferrus could face a crisis of faith if its  most sacred "Earth Superstitions" are proven ineffective or its most revered "Grounding Plate" is obliterated. It  might evolve its understanding of "being in the body" in response to new Ratchetwork threats, potentially incorporating new rituals  or reinterpreting old ones. Encounters with particularly persuasive Liquescent followers or undeniable evidence of transcendence could challenge its core  beliefs, leading to deeper entrenchment or subtle shifts in perspective.`
